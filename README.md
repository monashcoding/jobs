# MAC Job Board

<!-- TODO: add a description here maybe -->

## Getting Started

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20
  - If you think you will need multiple Node.js versions on your machine, using a version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [fnm](https://fnm.vercel.app/), or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) will save you a lot of headache
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- Run `pnpm start` to start the website!

See the readmes for in `frontend`/`backend`/`shared` for more detailed instructions.
